# Books about R

I recommend the four textbooks on R co-authored by Hadley Wickham, which are available for free as e-books (published using `quarto` or `bookdown`):

> -   [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/), with Garrett Grolemund, is the place to start if you want to learn how to do data science with R.
>
> -   [ggplot2: elegant graphics for data analysis](https://ggplot2-book.org/) shows you how to use ggplot2 to create graphics that help you understand your data.
>
> -   [Advanced R](http://adv-r.hadley.nz/) helps you master R as a programming language, teaching you what makes R tick.
>
> -   [R packages](http://r-pkgs.org/) teaches good software engineering practices for R, using packages for bundling, documenting, and testing your code.
