I recently created a Fosstodon account to engage with the #rstats community there. So it seemed only natural to use `rtoot` (spiritual successor to `rtweet`) to publish my first "toot":

```{r}
#| eval: false

# https://github.com/schochastics/rtoot
# devtools::install_github("schochastics/rtoot")
# rtoot::auth_setup()
rtoot::post_toot(status = "my first rtoot #rstats\n
                 (published with the rtoot package: https://github.com/schochastics/rtoot)",
                 media = "mastodon-logo.png", 
                 alt_text = "Mastodon logo")
```

It worked!

![My first toot, published with the \`rtoot\` package.](my-toot.PNG){fig-alt="my first toot!"}

A Mastodon thread could be published using Quarto and custom `knitr` hooks. [Here](https://gist.github.com/eliocamp/e22bfd3912196d2403af6c558168a1a4) is an example using `rtweet` -- I will try to translate this to use `rtoot` instead.
